# IEEE-CEC-2023-Competition
The Platform for CEC 2024 Competition on "Super Large-scale Multiobjective Optimization for Status Assessment of Measuring Equipment"

**Please use the PlatEMO v4.4 as the platform for competition**

## Overview & Aim:
***
  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been a popular optimization tool for decades, which have shown promising performance in solving various benchmark optimization problems. Nevertheless, using EAs on multiobjective optimization with over 100 decision variables (large-scale multiobjective optimization problems, LSMOPs) remains challenging due to the "curse of dimensionality". This phenomenon is more significant for LSMOPs in complex man-made systems, e.g., railway systems, social networks, and power systems. Specifically, EAs suffer from difficulties in dealing with enormous search space, irregularity in variable interactions and objective functions, and the existence of massive local optima for LSMOPs in emerging and critical applications. Existing optimization algorithms may cost unbearable function evaluations (FEs) and computation time (time complexity) to obtain acceptably converged/diverse results. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is more serious when the number of decision variables increases from large scale (>100) to super large scale (>1,000,000), where the limitation in storage memory rises due to the increased space complexity. Both time and memory efficiency, as well as search effectiveness, should be considered when dealing with super large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (SSMOPs), for filling the gap between complex real-world optimization and advanced optimization algorithms.

* In this competition, we carefully format three SSMOPs from one interesting real-world application: online status assessment of instrument transformers in wide-area power systems (OSA-IT). The IEEE 30-node standard topology, refer to Figure 1, with a time-varying workload is modelled and simulated to obtain measured data of the system, aiming to assess the status of instrument transformers. Generally, the time-varying voltages, currents, and system-level parameters are formatted as decision variables, the differences between the estimated results and physical rules of the system are modelled as the objectives. Three OSA-IT problems with 1 million, 10 million, and 100 million decision variables are given in this competition (the detailed descriptions will be given in the competition website). As an extension of the TREE test suite, this competition is expected to promote the research in smart grid and advanced optimization algorithms, and to explore some potential research directions for super large scale optimization, especially for the community of computational intelligence.

* Participants are encouraged to develop the algorithm to solve this type of optimization problem, not just a specific one of them. Participants may propose a new optimization algorithm or utilize a hybrid form of previously proposed algorithms. Remarkably, it is not restricted in the field of evolutionary computing, and using commercial optimization software is allowed. Participants are required to submit their own source codes, a brief description of the optimization algorithm, and a brief code instruction. Organizers will carry out the performance evaluation of your proposed algorithm in all three problems to guarantee its fairness. With the same computational budget, the best solution of each problem obtained by running your algorithm 1 time will be compared directly.

## Platform & Parameter settings
Participants are encouraged to develop the algorithm to solve this type of optimization problem, not just a specific one of them. Participants may propose a new optimization algorithm or utilize a hybrid form of previously proposed algorithms. Notably, it is not restricted in the field of evolutionary computing. Participants are required to submit their own source codes, a brief description of the optimization algorithm, a brief code instruction, and the data generated by the platform. Organizers will assess the quality of your submitted data in all six problems to guarantee its fairness. With the same computational budget, the best solution for each problem obtained by randomly running your algorithm 1 times will be compared directly. 

The PlatEMO v4.4 will be used as the competition platform for fair comparisons (PlatEMO v4.4), with population size (N=50), number of independent runs (run=1), and number of results (1). The code of an example settings is give as 
```
platemo('problem',@ETT1,'algorithm',@NSGAII,'N',50,'maxFE',1e7,'save',1)
```
  
* The test problems are
  ETT1 (D=1251016), ETT2 (D=12510016), ETT3 (D=125100016),
  The maximum number of function evaluations (***maxFE=1e7, 1e6, 1e5 for the three problems, respectively ***).
